OVERVIEW

This is the repo for the cloud-analytics project, including agents,
daemons, libraries, etc.  Project lead is Dave Pacheco (dap@joyent.com).

Subdirectories in this repo include:

cmd
	source files implementing executables, including servers and
	command line tools

deps
	library dependencies

lib
	source files implementing library code, shared by multiple
	consumers

tools
	miscellaneous tools, including

	jsl - javascript lint
	jsstype - javascript style checker based on OpenSolaris's cstyle
	ws - set up environment for running executables


COMMANDS

To run commands, you generally use:

	$ tools/ws
	$ node cmd/<source>.js

The "ws" tool takes care of setting NODE_PATH appropriately.


NOTES

Checked in code should be lint-clean and jsstyle-clean.

The "jsl" implementation here assumes a Solaris environment and several
Python-related paths.  It should work on a stock COAL-S zone, as of
November, 2010.

XXX node-kstat, node-libdtrace dependencies
