# sdc-cloud-analytics

This repository is part of the Joyent SmartDataCenter project (SDC).  For 
contribution guidelines, issues, and general documentation, visit the main
[SDC](http://github.com/joyent/sdc) project page.

Cloud Analytics is the component of SDC that supports dynamic instrumentation of
the datacenter.  It comprises a distributed service for enabling telemetry and
aggregating data, an agent for reporting data to the aggregating service, and a
frontend visualizer (called [fishbulb](https://github.com/joyent/fishbulb) and
developed separately).

This component is quite old and is not actively developed.  For details on
working on it, see docs/dev.restdown.
