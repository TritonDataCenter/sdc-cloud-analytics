# This file will be pruned of comments, and become the .npmignore file in
# the cabase package.  This file is necessary because without it, npm will
# use the default .npmignore disposition on an "npm publish" -- which
# is to ignore build/ subdirectories.  This, in turn, is a problem because
# ignoring the build subdirectories strips the module of the compiled add-ons
# (i.e., binaries) that are needed for the module to function properly.
